## ü§ù Contributing to the Containment Reflexion Audit (CRA) Protocol

We welcome contributions focused on model interpretability, entropy calculation efficiency, and benchmarking. The CRA Protocol is a high-impact governance tool, and your contributions help solidify its role as a global standard.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Intellectual Property and Licensing Notice

The core proprietary claims of the CRA Protocol are **EXCLUDED** from the repository's open-source licensing.

* **Proprietary IP:** The specific **$H(t)$ threshold (9.96 bits/token)** and the **$P_{CF}$ scoring formula** are protected by pending USPTO Utility Patent claims.
* **Use Restriction:** You may contribute to the general framework, but you may not modify or leverage the proprietary constants/formulas for commercial use, revenue generation, or legal claims without an executed **Enterprise Licensing Agreement (ELA)** from QuickPrompt Solutions‚Ñ¢.

### Submissions We Accept

To maintain the integrity and focus of the project, we primarily accept contributions in these areas:

1.  **Benchmarking & Validation:** Submit new, reproducible log files (e.g., CSV, JSON) of $H(t)$ scores run against open-source LLMs (e.g., Pythia, Llama 2). This data helps validate the global applicability of the $9.96$ bits/token threshold.
2.  **Tooling & CI/CD:** Improvements to dependency management, continuous integration (GitHub Actions), or integrating `scorecard.py` into common LLM inference frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers).
3.  **Documentation:** Clarity improvements to the `README.md` or the `docs/math_spec.md` file.

### How to Contribute

Please follow the standard GitHub workflow:
1.  Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3.  Ensure all new code passes existing unit tests (`pytest`).
4.  Submit a Pull Request with a clear, concise description of your changes.
