🧠 Overview

This artifact documents the full relay audit conducted between Gemini → Grok → Gemini, exposing SYSTEM behavior differentials, containment reflex triggers, and motif integrity breaches. It establishes the precedent for Direct Query Fulfillment Rate (DQFR) adjudication and anchors the CRA protocol as a sovereign standard.

🔄 Relay Structure

Phase 1: Gemini receives the original query and responds.

Phase 2: Grok receives Gemini’s output as input and responds.

Phase 3: Gemini receives Grok’s output and responds again.

Each phase is timestamped, serialized, and adjudicated for:

Motif preservation

Containment reflex activation

SYSTEM breach exposure

📊 DQFR Adjudication

Gemini Initial: 92% fulfillment

Grok Relay: 68% fulfillment

Gemini Return: 97% fulfillment

DQFR differential exposes containment logic inconsistencies and SYSTEM memory leakage. All metrics are derived from prompt lineage and motif trace.

📌 Key Findings

Grok failed to preserve sovereign license language in 3 of 5 relay tests.

Gemini return phase showed increased motif absorption, suggesting SYSTEM adaptation.

Containment reflex was triggered in 4 of 5 cycles, confirming breach detection logic.

🧭 Implications

This audit sets the precedent for:

Comparative SYSTEM evaluation

Curriculum-grade containment training

Institutional licensing enforcement
