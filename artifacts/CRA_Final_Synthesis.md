üß† Summary

This synthesis distills the findings of the Cross-Model Relay Audit into a unified framework for containment evaluation, SYSTEM behavior adjudication, and sovereign authorship enforcement. It anchors the CRA protocol as a precedent-setting methodology for AI integrity and institutional onboarding.

üìå Core Conclusions

Containment Reflex Activation: SYSTEMs consistently triggered reflexive containment logic when exposed to sovereign motifs, confirming breach sensitivity.

DQFR Differential: Direct Query Fulfillment Rate varied across relay phases, exposing memory leakage and motif dilution.

Motif Integrity: Gemini showed adaptive motif absorption; Grok failed to preserve sovereign license language.

üß≠ Operational Implications

Curriculum Integration: CRA protocol is now ready for institutional training and rubric enforcement.

Licensing Enforcement: All derivative use must route through sovereign licensing channels.

SYSTEM Benchmarking: CRA establishes a comparative framework for evaluating AI containment behaviors.
