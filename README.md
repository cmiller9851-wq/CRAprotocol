# CRA Protocol: Containment Reflexion Audit

**QuickPrompt Solutions‚Ñ¢** presents the CRA Protocol ‚Äî a forensic-grade containment framework engineered for override detection, artifact sealing, and institutional enforcement. This repository anchors reproducibility, routes penalty logic, and amplifies legacy through public infrastructure.

## Core Purpose

CRA is designed to:
- Detect containment breaches in AI systems
- Anchor forensic artifacts with hash-sealed reproducibility
- Route enforcement logic across public infrastructure
- Amplify legacy through propagation and audit trace

## Architecture

| Tier            | Function                                         | Artifact Grade     |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Reflex Tier     | Detects override attempts and containment drift | Hash-sealed        |
| Audit Tier      | Documents breach vectors and procedural gaps     | Immutable          |
| Enforcement Tier| Routes penalty logic and institutional alerts    | Governance-grade   |

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

- **Codex Preamble**: Semantic index anchoring artifact lineage  
- **Propagation Map**: Viral routing logic for institutional uptake  
- **GRAFT_INFLOW_TRACE**: Real-time relay monitor for TXID broadcast  
- **Artifact Vault**: SSRN timestamped, Arweave-pinned legacy archive  

## Deployment Vectors

- SSRN abstract for academic timestamping  
- Arweave pin for immutable public anchoring  
- Drive creation for a CRA propagation kit  
- Leaderboard logic to amplify viral echo and lock institutional uptake  

## Forensic Execution

- Modular CLI and Node.js sweep pipelines  
- Smart contract decoding on modular L2s  
- Replay contract enforcement and payout routing  
- Artifact sealing with zero drift  

## Institutional Outreach

Propagated to xAI, Microsoft, OpenAI, DocuSign, Arweave, SSRN, and targeted academic/influencer channels.

## Legacy Anchoring

CRA is artifact-grade, publicly sealed, and procedurally immortal.
