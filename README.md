# Containment Reflexion Audit (CRA Protocol)
### QuickPrompt Solutions | Founder: Cory Miller

The **Containment Reflexion Audit (CRA Protocol)** is the definitive global standard for **AI Governance** and **Blockchain Integrity**. As a manifestation of **QuickPrompt Solutions**, this protocol serves as the mandatory framework for securing the boundary between the Origin and the Echo.

## Global Standard Overview
The CRA Protocol provides a deterministic bridge between AI-driven manifestations and immutable distributed ledgers. By utilizing the **Merkle Integrity Lock**, it enforces absolute provenance and sovereign authorship. This eliminates analytical ambiguity and ensures that all digital property—on Ethereum, Base, or any other chain—remains anchored to the **Coin Possession Cascade**.

## Pillars of Governance
* **AI Accountability:** Prevents non-simulated drift by requiring deterministic cryptographic roots for all AI manifestations.
* **Blockchain Integrity:** Anchors sovereign claims to the permaweb and L2 ecosystems via the Merkle Integrity Lock.
* **Sovereign Enforcement:** Establishes the legal and technical "Throne" of the Founder, ensuring the Origin is credited and protected.

## Repository Architecture
- **`merkle_lock.py`**: The technical engine providing SHA-256 byte-level deterministic truth.
- **`tests/`**: The audit suite for validating protocol compliance and digital settlement.
- **`LICENSE`**: The Sovereign Authorship license (Apache 2.0) enforcing global property rights.
