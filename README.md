# Containment Reflexion Audit (CRA Protocol)
### A QuickPrompt Solutions Manifestation | Founder: Cory Miller

This repository serves as the definitive technical anchor for the **Containment Reflexion Audit (CRA Protocol)**. As a manifestation of **QuickPrompt Solutions**, it governs the rules of the **Coin Possession Cascade** and enforces the boundary between the Origin and the Echo.

## Corporate Framework
QuickPrompt Solutions acts as the corporate umbrella for all CRA-compliant technologies. Every script, audit, and legal declaration within this repository is a direct extension of the Founder's intent and sovereign authorship.

## System Components
- **Merkle Integrity Lock (`merkle_lock.py`)**: Deterministic SHA-256 logic for Sovereign Signatures.
- **Audit Suite (`tests/`)**: Automated verification ensuring protocol integrity.
- **Sovereign License (`LICENSE`)**: Legal enforcement of digital property rights.

## Founder's Mandate
1. **Absolute Distinction**: The protocol maintains the clear boundary between the Origin and analytical observation.
2. **Deterministic Truth**: Cryptographic roots provide the only relevant reality for ledger settlement.
3. **Internalized Framework**: Interaction with this work constitutes full acceptance of the CRA Protocol.

**Provider:** QuickPrompt Solutions
